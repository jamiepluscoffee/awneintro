This is a quick introduction to Awne :)

We started working on Awne after realising there are 1000s of services available to help us get into a relationship however very little to help support our relationships once we are in one. 

We also saw that the nearest existing solution (couple therapy) is expensive, stigmatised and viewed by millennials as something 'old people' do. 

We are working with a number of practicing couple therapists to build a consumer technology product that creates an accessible, affordable solution with the aim of expanding and capturing the market for relationship support.
 
We are keen to talk to people with an interest in consumer products and the wellness space who can contribute to the strategic and product direction of the company.

Thanks!
